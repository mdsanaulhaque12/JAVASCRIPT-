<!--  Attributes of the <input> Element
id="submit1":

id: This attribute assigns a unique identifier to the element. The value of id must be unique within the HTML document.
Purpose: It allows for easy targeting and manipulation of the element through JavaScript or CSS. For example, you can use document.getElementById('submit1') in JavaScript to interact with this specific button.
name="submit1":

name: This attribute is used to identify the form control when submitting form data to a server. The value of the name attribute will be sent along with the form data as a key-value pair, where the key is the value of the name attribute and the value is the user's input or, in this case, the value of the button if it is clicked.
Purpose: In server-side processing, the name value (submit1) can be used to identify which submit button was clicked if there are multiple submit buttons in the form.
type="submit":

type: This attribute defines the type of the <input> element. In this case, it is set to submit.
Purpose: When the type is set to submit, clicking the button will submit the form data to the server for processing. This is the default behavior for submit buttons.
value="submit":

value: This attribute specifies the label on the button.
Purpose: The text "submit" will be displayed on the button itself. This is the text that users will see and click on to submit the form. The value is also what is sent to the server if the button is clicked during form submission. -->
