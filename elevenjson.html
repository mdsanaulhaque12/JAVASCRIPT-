//json --java script object notation

json is lighter version alternative for xml 

xml was introducesd to :
1.transfer data 
2.store data
3.structure data

an application where one part is running on Machine 1 and another 
part on Machine 2, making it a distributed application.
 If one part of the application is written in one technology
  and the other part in a different technology, and if App 1
   is reading data from a database, you'll need a method to
    transfer this data from App 1 to App 2, which is written 
    in another language.

Historically, XML was often used for data transfer between
 different parts of an application. However, parsing XML is 
 not easy, leading to a demand for alternatives.
  As a result, a lightweight data format called JSON became popular.
   JSON is easier to parse and more efficient for data exchange 
   between applications.
